# Junction Connected 2020 VR for pain relief project
VR has proven to relief pain. Most famous game is SnowWorld VR, but it's not accessible (not on Steam, App Store, etc). 

We want to create game that allows to distract oneself away from pain with fun VR experience, that can be used anywhere, from any mobile device.

That's why we're using WebVR. Works on a phone with or without (like Google CardBoard -> I bought "iBOX" from local shop for 13EUR), desktop computers and on dedicated VR headsets
