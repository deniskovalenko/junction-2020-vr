      <h1>VR Pain Relief Game</h1> 
      <section id="start">
        <p> Dealing with pain and treatment anxiety is challenging, especially for kids. </p>
        <p>Research proves that Virtual Reality (VR) experience can reduce pain and anxiety during procedures. 
          It's applied already in certain hospitals, but using traditional VR headsets is out of reach for many still. 
        </p>
        <p>That's why we think it's crucial to bring this tool to more people, by building VR game that can be used with any device, right from the browser.
          Tune in to see what we've built during the weekend at Junction Connected 2020!
